68	0	a	Perdon my French , I guess , since it didn't make you laugh :-)
69	0	a	I'd say you are just expressing your personal preference , but that has no relation to the band's success .
70	0	a	I hope you aren't deceiving our users in order to split the Democratic tickets in future elections .
71	1	a	In my experience , there's no way these SSIDs would not be counted as part of your metered connection .

81	0	a	Yeah , I prefer your mom's erotic love letters to my non-family member , though Breitbart's a close second .
82	1	a	Add in petty condescension for good measure and yeah , people are naturally going to react to your being an asshole .
83	1	a	but from my understanding you still need to keep the original enclosure to service it .
84	1	a	To get pieces that last as long as yours , we typically need to spend more than you .
85	0	a	you're confusing germany's need for censorship with what i want and you're accusing me of being a racist .

175	0	a	Oh my goodness , I'm so happy to see a happy update for you .
176	1	a	In my experience , if you present it as a choice , children will pick the easy one .
177	0	a	That sounds impossibly high , even before you exclude network promos .
178	0	a	But when you fire the guy who's investigating your campaigns ties to Russian interference into our election process .
179	0	a	if it makes you feel better , all of my kids have been birth control fails .
180	0	a	I can't find one example of him unilaterally making family decisions without your input and say-so .

191	0	a	I'd definitely sand and paint that if I were you .
192	0	a	I dont know you but i think you stole my blanket and my cat .
193	0	a	Stuff like that really depends on your own preference and whatnot , like i absolutely love the game .

232	0	a	I love that you support our sport .
233	0	a	While we disagree on the abortion issue I do understand your mixed feelings about the death penalty .
234	1	a	Additionally , I can easily give you reasons why nuclear power isn't the answer to our energy concerns .
235	1	a	i'd argue that's veering towards an unhealthy outlook on life , like some sort of weird masochistic-sacrificial-jesus-died-for-your-net-happiness mentality .
236	0	a	You don't reach on a QB just because you need one .
237	0	a	I would say same as that of any other domesticated animal you buy these days .
