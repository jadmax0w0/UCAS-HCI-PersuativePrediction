1733	0	a	although it does disgust me to my core that self loathing fucks like you exist
1734	1	a	A sad result of a mentality among some that my ignorance is as good as your knowledge .
1735	0	a	Happy New Year I get that you disagree , you just haven't provided any actual arguments for * why * .
1736	0	a	She gets nit picky and you say : I'm sorry it wasn't good enough for you .
1737	0	a	But I don't see anything really wrong with doing it your way either .
1738	0	a	I think I know where you are ( in general ) , and my sincere condolences .
1739	0	a	I don't know how many times I've explained to you why this is .

1758	0	a	How you can support such a piece of shit is beyond all of our collective understanding .
1759	0	a	Thankfully , NONE of that depends on your approval , disapproval , OR opinion .
1760	0	a	I don't particularly care if you trust my account of the story .
1761	0	a	But your concern is valid , and that's why we have laws against incitement to violence .
1762	0	a	But thank you for reminding me how far we still have to go in getting true professionals in place .

1835	0	a	What evidence do you have for the government interfering being the cause of these problems ?
1836	1	a	I can tell you that confidence is not something you're born with just using my personal experience .
1837	0	a	Basically I tell you all that because I can't stand our hospital's IT decisions and wanted to whine .

1849	0	a	I want that to sink in for you , since you clearly believe that this child knows what is happening .
1850	0	a	But even if my job sucked for a couple of weeks , sometimes you just have to get out .
1851	1	a	If you change someone's chromosomes , they are a different person .
1852	0	a	I'm a college student right now and my experience disagrees with yours ...

1869	0	a	A lot of tensions between my group and yours simply wouldn't be .
1870	0	a	I just hope you give us folks the benefit of the doubt .
1871	0	a	you post on t_d all the time ... i highly doubt you care about seeing anyone else's perspective .
1872	0	a	I said literally nothing about my personal feelings on him killing , I'm only addressing your weak argument .
