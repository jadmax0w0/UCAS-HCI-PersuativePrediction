194	1	a	My suggestion would be to cruise around Linkedin to check out people that are following a similar path from you .
195	0	a	I understand where you are coming from , but I think that it's a double edged sword .
196	1	a	My father just turned 70 , and I myself am 33 , similar to you .

211	0	a	Consider how I feel when you characterize my lack of concern for a not-seriously-injured person as misogyny .
212	0	a	After that experience i decided to no longer pursue internships because really you get ( expletive ) on .
213	0	a	One thing I discovered is that when you grew up suicidal , like pre - 18 , your mind grows up around it .
214	0	a	I'm sorry you're so insecure to think I had any malice in my post .
215	0	a	I hate to admit it , but you might be right .
