156	0	a	Since you're unhappy with the data , I went ahead and reclassified the Modern and Legacy decks .
157	0	a	But if you think that everything is consciousness because everything we're experience is happening in our mind .
158	0	a	I wouldn't have actually said what you mentioned , but I wouldn't have known what to say .
159	1	a	Sorry , you're right , I should've paid attention to fact it was posed as a question .
160	0	a	You can take whatever value you want from sports , man .

176	1	a	Thanks , rest of your response makes alot of sense , confirms my previous beliefs .

184	0	a	I just hope you give us folks the benefit of the doubt .
185	0	a	It has nothing to do with my opinion and everything to do with your ability to obey the law .

203	0	a	This is where you and I show our different backgrounds .
204	0	a	While what you're saying is true , POC are becoming more and more prevalent in our country .
205	1	a	No matter where this relationship goes , my advice is to own your greatness .
206	0	a	Thank you for understanding - - if not all of our reasons , at least for trying .
207	0	a	You might not be reading them , but in his mind , you still have a connection because he is writing them .
208	0	a	With that said , we don't know what you need or your finances .
209	0	a	This is not true and I have receipts to prove we paid tuition just like you .
210	0	a	Also , you're having a laugh if you think we play beautiful football this isn't 2008 .
211	0	a	Legally , under our constitution , no you cannot use race as a determinative factor in something like sentencing .
212	0	a	Fuck off trying to talk about my intelligence when you claim you're amazing but can't win a bad matchup
213	0	a	Even if we accept your background belief as true , it still doesnt create a justified argument .
214	1	a	I do get what you're saying , and you do make the point well .
215	0	a	But yes , my happiness is continuing and it makes me so sad to see yours ended 😞

219	0	a	I know how you feel , I have had a strained relationship with my parents my whole life .

221	0	a	i'd love to see the contract where you think these exchanges happen though .
222	0	a	Ok then here's my suggestion , Dear guests , We're excited to celebrate our wedding with you !
223	1	a	But we should have not created a third behemoth bureaucracy ( DHS ) rather than just fixing the issues you mention .
224	0	a	I love my wife , but your 30 ' s could have been a lot of fun .
225	0	a	The nationalism we are talking about isn't being proud of your nation .
226	0	a	Target your vitriol towards the policies and policy-makers that are looking out for personal interests over our freedoms .
227	0	a	I think you're confusing vocal cords with spines because this doesn't mean anything until they actually do something .
228	0	a	I think you're better off on your own than with an unsupportive partner anyway .
229	0	a	Exmuslims aren't your token minority , we aren't your allies in your white nationalist sympathies related to changing demographics .
230	0	a	American here I'm just as sick of it as you are .

238	0	a	Like you , I have generally tied my self-worth up in my actions , abilities , and achievements .
239	0	a	I'm trying to figure out what in game behaviour could possibly qualify as intentional feeding under your system .
240	0	a	I think you are mistaking my ability to express myself for some kind of emotional outburst .
241	0	a	Sounds like you've got underlying issues besides trust that in my opinion are bigger problems .
242	0	a	I think we can agree grip training may be necessary depending on your goals but its not for everybody .
243	1	a	great feedback , i like how you gave a great explanation as to why .
244	0	a	I think only an expert in the field can analyze you my friend .
245	0	a	But can you honestly imagine religious organisations in this country accepting blame to that part of our history .
246	0	a	So yea , your ideal pie-in-the-sky system has never existed like my perfect dictator has never existed .

259	1	a	Thank you for sharing something so intimate and personal for our education and benefit .
260	0	a	The only difference here is our interpretation , and yours is very selective and intentionally negative .
261	0	a	While your replay was well thought out and written don't send it .
262	0	a	You have to have evidence of the streamer themselves saying they're viewbotting or else there is nothing you can do .
263	0	a	Would be a situation that you vehemently oppose based on our belief that all man is created equal .
264	0	a	sense basically you use your social intelligence to get laid ( easiest explanation i can come up with ) .
265	0	a	I'll be awaiting , with bated breath , the fruits of your victory ripening , Derek .

271	1	a	I offer my hand of friendship out to you , I hope you'll accept it .
272	0	a	and my point is you already tried centrism to fight fascism and you lost .
273	0	a	From personal experience I can tell you that the news does not report every target we hit .
274	0	a	The person you are replying to is not saying that it should not be classified as a mental disorder .
275	0	a	I'm guessing if you squeeze it when empty , it creates suction .
276	0	a	I'm kind of stunned that you and several others didn't catch the obvious sarcasm of my post .
277	0	a	Some people like frills , just because you don't it doesn't make them bad .
278	0	a	Let's see what information we can find to backup you contention that under-performing education should be privatized .
279	0	a	The question : tell me about a time you were presented a difficult problem .
