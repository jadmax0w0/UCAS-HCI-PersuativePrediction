445	0	a	I'm purely speaking from my experience and others may give you other advice , but .
446	0	a	I'm starting to think they teach you this cop-out in Sunday School .
447	0	a	Come around to our way of thinking or we will purge the party of people of your political persuasion .
448	0	a	When you first start out , on your first day , and you know NOTHING you get paired with some blue belt .
449	0	a	Sounds like you'd enjoy my hobby .
450	0	a	I'm not touching your shit rag even with double gloves .
451	0	a	It's a good sign that you are asking to be conscious of this stuff !
452	0	a	The life skills and friendship you gain completely out weighs the risks in my mind .
453	0	a	However , you're also wrong in that of pairings we know , the majority are same-sex .
454	0	a	It's more like you're haunting my online existence and it's annoying .
455	0	a	Also it's creepy and weird the way you say ' my America ' .
456	0	a	but I assure you this guy wouldn't agree to any of them .
457	0	a	As you can see , all of my power generation , batteries and crafting areas are destroyed and on fire .
458	0	a	Although I respect your optimism , you don't just take kids away from someone .
459	0	a	We're discovering that the environment plays a much more active roll in your genetics than we thought .
460	0	a	But again , to make my main point clear , Brexit doesn't have to be bitter like your attitude .
461	0	a	But ultimately my choice is my responsibility ; just as your beliefs are your responsibility to choose .
462	0	a	I'd say if you like the new tomb raiders and assassins creed it's worth it .
463	0	a	Namely if you invade my sphere of rights .
464	0	a	The fact that you responded so hostile only proves my point .
465	0	a	To answer your question - no , not unless our entire body reshaped itself .

472	0	a	I'm asking you to provide ant evidence or reasoning that could make me change my view .
473	0	a	I am sure you guys must be so proud people already have to resign 24 days in .
474	0	a	You aren't wrong , but something about this doesn't sit right with me .
475	0	a	If personality type defined your interests , then we wouldn't have obvious cultures for each community .
476	0	a	Down vote and move on you don't have to insult .
477	0	a	If your ex knows who she is then why did nothing come of your police report ?
478	0	a	I will try to give you an example from my perspective .
479	0	a	I think you need to tone down the porn / fantasizing other women .
480	0	a	I think the problem with your premise is that you're assuming everything had to do with slavery in that period .
481	0	a	Thanks for your response , apologies for the ill-posing of my question .
482	0	a	But why does my understanding of God and your understanding of God differ so greatly .

493	1	a	My HUMAN credit card number is so FUNNY , you go first !
494	0	a	So are we racist , sexist , bigoted homophobes for using a term that you don't like .
495	0	a	But you were rebutting my first point by stating the abuse would be premeditated .
496	0	a	Maybe it's just my personal opinion , but I believe you should make your MC likable first .
497	0	a	Are you talking about the one that robbed you of a normal family ?
498	0	a	I'm in California , but I'll wear my silkies and cheer you on from here .
499	0	a	Using the same app you are , my 5s shows exactly the same battery degradation .
500	0	a	Under your rules we are not allowed to criticise any viewpoint regardless of how nonsensical it is .
501	0	a	To build on your idea , we should have special camps where they go to work and eventually disappear .
502	0	a	My reaction against your opinion is not my opinion , but rather the standard of the judicious scientific community .
503	0	a	Before you argue about how you'd pay for ones you use , I have 2 counterpoints : 1 .
504	0	a	Okay History student here who is about to start studying the Crusades , because I think that's what you're hinting at .
505	0	a	I hold you personally responsible for cursing one of our largest financial institutions by turning it into a meme .
506	0	a	From my perspective , what you did was disrespectful and dishonest .
507	0	a	Hate crimes seriously say we are punishing you because you killed this person for the wrong reason .
508	0	a	And you have no idea how ignorant and racist and violent my fucking neighbors are .
509	0	a	He's definitely a trust fund my dad will sue you !

524	0	a	I think we have very different world views and I'm chill not understanding yours .
525	0	a	Message me when you graduate high school and we can have a civil discussion on the statistics .
526	0	a	From my experience Generating your own is usually always better .

528	0	a	I was so worried you'd need two copies of the game !
529	0	a	congratulations , you just triggered my PTSD .
530	0	a	Even if you're not concerned about hurting animals , just stop littering you assholes .

548	0	a	there's no set name for it , but i'm sure you can find other people with a similar sound .
549	0	a	That may sound shitty , but I don't think I should have to pay because your kid breaks stuff .
550	0	a	your nurturing instinct talk is a cultural construct too , but i'll admit it might also have biological basis .
